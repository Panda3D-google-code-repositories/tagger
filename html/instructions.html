Tagger is a multiplayer game.  Everyone on the internet who enters the
game at the same time automatically enters the same world together.
Invite your friends to play too!

<p>Gameplay is very simple: use the arrow keys, or the WASD keys, to
move your character around the maze.  Click and drag in the window
with the mouse to paint.  The more you paint, the higher your score!
After about a three minute round, the scores are tallied, and the
player with the highest score is the winner.

<p>While you're playing, you can choose to upload a "poster".  You can
pick any photo or image on your computer.  When you upload a poster,
it will be displayed on a random wall in the maze, for you and other
people to see.  Hang up a poster that makes you and your friends
laugh.

<p>The scoring rules for Tagger are intricate.  You get:
<ul>

  <li>10 points for each unit of paint anywhere in the world.

  <li>100 points per wall section owned (you own it if there's more of
  your paint than anyone else's).

  <li>You <em>lose</em> 100 points for "owning" a floor or ceiling
  section.  Don't be sloppy with your paint!
  
  <li>Extra bonus multiplier(s) for owning many walls.

  <li>100 points per unit of paint on another player.
  
  <li>If you get paint on another player, your spray can gets more
  powerful. If another player gets paint on you, your spray can gets
  more feeble.

  <li>Another player can paint over your paint to take your points
  away.

  <li>At the end of the round, the three most ornately painted wall
  sections are awarded first, second, and third prizes, for big
  bonuses to the player who owns them.

  <li>If a wall with your poster on it wins one of the end-of-game
  prizes, <em>you</em> get the bonus instead of the player who painted
  it!

  <li>The three prize-winning wall sections are also carried forward
  into the next round.  If you earned one or more of these awards, you
  will start the next round with a fancy wall painting already in your
  name!
