This is a little side project I've been working on--a simple online multiplayer game built using Panda (and its new browser plugin system). When it's done, I'll release it along with the source code, to be a useful demo of both using the plugin system, and Panda's built-in multiplayer networking interfaces (i.e. the DistributedObject system). 

It's still a rough work in progress, but I think it's playable. Come give it a try!

Since it's a multiplayer game, it's more fun if there are multiple people in the game at the same time. Invite your friends. :) 

The gameplay is very simple: run around and spray paint walls (use the mouse to paint). You get points for painting more than anyone else. 

More specifically, you get: 
* 100 points per wall section owned (you own it if there's more of your paint than anyone else's). 
* 10 points per unit of paint anywhere 
* Extra bonus multiplier(s) for owning many walls 
* If you get paint on another player, your spray can gets more powerful. If another player gets paint on you, your spray can gets more feeble. 

At the end of the 3-minute round, points are tallied up. The three most ornately painted wall sections are awarded first, second, and third prizes, for big bonuses to the player who owns them. 

Extra wrinkle: you can define up to five "posters" at the beginning of the game. These are loaded onto random walls. If a wall with your poster on it wins one of the end-of-game prizes, you get the bonus instead of the player who painted it! 

Then the whole game starts over again. The sooner you click "Play Again", the sooner you can start painting. :) 

Feedback is certainly welcome and requested. I'm still working out the details of gameplay and scoring.
